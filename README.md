# 📊 Occupational Value (OVP) Dashboard

The **Occupational Value (OVP) Dashboard** is an interactive Streamlit web app that helps users explore the motivational structure of work.  
It identifies the **Occupational Value Profile (OVP)** for a single occupation and compares it against four benchmark occupations.

## 🔎 Purpose
Work is more than tasks — it is a structure that permits or restricts the satisfaction of core psychological needs.  
The OVP Dashboard provides insight into how well a given occupation supports these six work values from the **Theory of Work Adjustment (TWA):**

- **Achievement**  
- **Independence**  
- **Recognition**  
- **Relationships**  
- **Support**  
- **Working Conditions**
